# Implement the proposed plan

Implement the plan specified in the $ARGUMENTS with the following requirements:

- Always follow the plan exactly

- Never make assumptions - if you have questions, research them before proceeding or pause and ask the user
- Always create and perform extensive unit tests between Phases or Implementation Steps
- IMPORTANT: Use Serena to search through the codebase.  If you get any errors using Serena, retry with different Serena tools.
- Think hard
