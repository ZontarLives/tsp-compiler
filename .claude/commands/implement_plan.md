# Implement the proposed plan

Implement the plan specified in the $ARGUMENTS with the following requirements:

- Declare the name of the plan, if it is written in a document.
- Read the plan carefully and always follow it exactly.
- If there are gaps in the logic, pause and ask questions to answer those gaps, before continuing.
- Prior to writing code, create a detailed todo list for each step and/or phase and display it.
- At the completion of each Implementation Step or Phase, update the todo list and display it.
- Do not get creative and add code because you think it may be needed in future development.
- Do not create new methods or functions that are not defined in the design.  If you encounter something undefined, this is an error in the design and development must be paused until a solution is discovered.
- IMPORTANT: Never make assumptions - if you have questions, research them before proceeding or pause and ask the user
- IMPORTANT: Use Serena to search through the codebase.  If you get any errors using Serena, retry with different Serena tools.
